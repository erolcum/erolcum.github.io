# Jekyll Now

>Kendi bilgisayarına hiçbir kurulum yapmadan (ruby vs.) online olarak kendi blog sayfanı **githubKullanıcıAdın.github.io** olarak oluşturabilirsin. [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) dan kendi github hesabına fork yapman yeterli oluyor. _config.yml dosyasına birkaç bilgi giriyorsun. Baktım ki oluşan sayfada arka fon rengi açık renk, kendim style.scss dosyasını oynayarak koyu temalı sayfa yaptım. Sayfama [buradan](https://erolcum.github.io/about/) bakabilirsin. HTML filan bilmeye gerek yok, markdown ile kolayca web sayfanı yapabilirsin..

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

**Jekyll Now** makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.

- You don't need to touch the command line
- You don't need to install/configure ruby, rvm/rbenv, ruby gems :relaxed:
- You don't need to install runtime dependencies like markdown processors, Pygments, etc
- If you're on Windows, this will make setting up Jekyll a lot easier
- It's easy to try out, you can just delete your forked repository if you don't like it

## Quick Start

### Step 1) Fork Jekyll Now to your User Repository

Fork this repo, then rename the repository to yourgithubusername.github.io.

Your Jekyll blog will often be viewable immediately at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io> (if it's not, you can often force it to build by completing step 2)

### Step 2) Customize and view your site

Enter your site name, description, avatar and many other options by editing the _config.yml file. You can easily turn on Google Analytics tracking, Disqus commenting and social icons here too.

Making a change to _config.yml (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with jekyll. Your rebuilt site will be viewable a few seconds later at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io> - if not, give it ten minutes as GitHub suggests and it'll appear soon
